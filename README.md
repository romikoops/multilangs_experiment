multilangs_experiment
=====================

Investigation of multilanguage supporting

---

A ruby translation project managed on [Locale](http://www.localeapp.com/) that's open to all!

## Contributing to multilangs_experiment

- Edit the translations directly on the [multilangs_experiment](http://www.localeapp.com/projects/public?search=multilangs_experiment) project on Locale.
- **That's it!**
- The maintainer will then pull translations from the Locale project and push to Github.

Happy translating!

To actualize js locales:

  rake js:locales
